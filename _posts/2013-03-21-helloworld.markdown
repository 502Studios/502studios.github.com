So this is our brand new blog, we (502 Studios) are a independent game development studio, based in Guatemala city, Guatemala, Central America.

The reason for this blog is to get exposure on our proyects, share all the stuff we have learned that can be helpfull to others seeking to develop videogames.

We are using Jekyll to power the blog and its based on the source of [Uber Robert](https://github.com/rbirnie) we will make some changes in the future.
